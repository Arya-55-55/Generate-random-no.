ðŸŽ¯ Guess the Number - Python Game
This is a simple terminal-based number guessing game built with Python. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible.

ðŸ§  How It Works
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.

The player enters guesses one by one.

After each guess, the program provides a hint:

"Lower number please." if the guess is too high.

"Higher number please." if the guess is too low.

Once the correct number is guessed, the program congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts taken.
